There are plenty of fine personal password managers out there, and there's no particular reason to use this. I like learning from challenges like this, and use it to develop prove out various techniques and use it as a reason to keep improving other my libraries, in particular [WinForms.Library](https://github.com/adamosoftware/WinForms.Library) and [Postulate for SQL Server Compact Edition](https://github.com/adamosoftware/Postulate/tree/master/Postulate.SqlCe).
